Evolutionary relationships of taxa 
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [1]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 1.90708294 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [2] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. This analysis involved 853 nucleotide sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 3663 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [3].
